# nosql-demo
This is a small repo for some very simple exercise / demos for usage of a NoSQL DB - [pouchdb](https://pouchdb.com/)

## Project setup

### Prerequisite
1. [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) (tested version: `v8.17.0`) 
2. [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (tested version: `1.22.4`)

(Note: yes, `pouchdb` does NOT need to be installed separately because it is a pure JavaScript implemented NoSQL DB and would be installed when you run `yarn` to install the `npm` dependencies. Hurrah! üéâ)  

### Setup steps
Check out this repo and run the following at the project root:
1. `yarn`

### Check project setup
If the project is setup correctly, you should be able to run the following:
1. `jest` - this would run all the tests under the project (but by default you should see all tests being red because this is the exercise - fix all of them! :-) ) 
2. `ts-node src/typescript/playground.ts` - this would run the `playground.ts` which is a, well, playground sandbox that you can mess around - feel free to experiment the [`pouchdb` APIs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html) there!

## Exercise

### Context
As mentioned in the deck, we would like to retrieve some data from and write some data to the `pouchdb` database.

The "spec" / "requirements" can be found at the `/src/typescript/systemDesignExercise.test.ts` - unfortunately the tests are all red right now. 

Can you please fix them? üê±

### Checking
We can run the tests by running: `jest`

And you should be able to see the test results. 

### Caveat

For simplicity, I had used the `pouchdb-adapter-memory` plugin for `pouchdb` so the databases created in the exercise are transient and stored in-memory (and thus would be reset for each run).

If you want to see how to persist the data (e.g. in files), feel free to take a look at `/src/typescript/fileBasedDatabaseExamples.ts`

### Need help?
Feel free to chat / slack me or shout in the slack group.

Or you may want to take a look at [the `pouchdb` documentations](https://pouchdb.com/) (trust me, they are pretty well-written):
1. [API](https://pouchdb.com/api.html)
2. [Learn](https://pouchdb.com/learn.html)
3. [Guides](https://pouchdb.com/guides/)
4. [Blogs](https://pouchdb.com/blog/)
    1. [A very good blog by `pouchdb` creator about `promise`](https://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html)

## Folder Structure
You can find all the source files you need under `src` folder.

In particular, you might want to look at the following files:
 1. `/src/typescript/systemDesignExercise.ts` + `/src/typescript/systemDesignExercise.test.ts` - these are the exercise files
 2. `/src/typescript/playground.ts` - this is a sandbox code which you can change and quickly test out the APIs
 3. `/src/typescript/fileBasedDatabaseExamples.ts` - this is an example usage of file-based `pouchdb` database - if you run this file, a folder `pouchdb_database` would be created with some `pouchdb` data files created inside

Feel free to ignore the other files such as `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `jest.config.js` for now (mainly for project configuration)
